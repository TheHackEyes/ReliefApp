                    <p class="story">David is an essential worker at a local restaurant. I was blown away 
                        by the amazing customer service and kindness he showed me and my friends. I will donate to him
                        and would encourage my friends to donate to him. Due to the pandemic I have had the pleasure of 
                        working from home and going out has become a rare event. David is an essential worker so he goes
                        out of his home daily. This is a small thank you for everything that he does.

                    <p class="story">Olivia Jones is my neighbor who has got into a car 
                        accident recently. She now needs to attend physical therapy 3 times a week.
                        Fortunaletly, she has insurance that will cover her medical  
                        bills but she needs to pay for weights and exercise equipment out of pocket. She needs to do these
                        exercises to regain her physical strength. I love my neighbor so I'm sending some funding her way to 
                        help her cover her costs. I would encourage my fellow neighbors to help her too.

                        loss of income due to not being able to work while hospitalized. Finances are a big worry
                        so I will donate to him to play a role in getting finances off his mind.
